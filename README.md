<h1 align="center"> I would call myself a Maker </h1>

And I like to make staff. And here are few repositories you can find on my profile:

## üíª TUI / Terminal

- [NoteSH](https://github.com/Cvaniak/NoteSH) is TUI app but feels like normal GUI. It is really something.
- [CHID](https://github.com/Cvaniak/CommandHistoryInDirectory) is tool that I use every day. It is surprising how helpful it is.
- [Hoptex](https://github.com/Cvaniak/Hoptex) is lib for **Textual** that allow to quickly focus widgets in [Hop](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim) style.
- [PixelArtTUI](https://github.com/Cvaniak/PixelArtTUI) there are better Paint-TUI apps now, but it was cool to write it.

## üß† Competitive Programming

- Every year I try to get all 50 ‚≠ê in [Advent Of Code](https://github.com/Cvaniak/AdventOfCode)

## üìù Docs

- [How To Anything](https://github.com/Cvaniak/How-To-Anything) - notes written post factum. If it would have been useful to you in the past it might be to someone in the future.

## ‚åö SmartWatch Apps

Same app for Garmin and Android SmartWatches. It was cool to see how these two ecosystems differs:

- [Rosary](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/5a796e37-f39f-468d-ba51-9643baada298) for Garmin Watches
- [Rosary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=my.first.rosary&pli=1) for Android Watches (WearOS)
